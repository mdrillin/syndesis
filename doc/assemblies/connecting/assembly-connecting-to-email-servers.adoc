= Connecting to Email Servers (IMAP, POP3, SMTP)
:context: email

An integration can connect to an IMAP or POP3 email server to 
retrieve email messages or 
connect to an SMTP email server to send email messages. To trigger integration
execution upon retrieving email, create a
connection to an IMAP or POP3 email server and then add that connection 
as a simple integration's start connection. 
To send an email from a flow, create a connection to an SMTP email 
server and then add that connection to the middle of a flow or to finish
a simple integration.
