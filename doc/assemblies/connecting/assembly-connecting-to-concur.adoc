= Connecting to SAP Concur
:context: concur

SAP Concur manages business expenses, travel, and invoices. 
In an integration, you can connect to SAP Concur and perform
any one of a large variety of SAP Concur actions.  
For example, suppose that you store project codes in a SQL database and
you need the same project codes in SAP Concur so that expenses can be
associated with projects. You can create an integration that 
connects to your SQL database and runs a stored procedure that obtains
any new project codes. The integration can then connect to SAP Concur and
upload the new project codes to the appropriate list.
