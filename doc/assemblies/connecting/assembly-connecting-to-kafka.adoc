= Connecting to Kafka
:context: kafka

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that you can use to
obtain and publish data. 
In an integration, you can subscribe for data from a Kafka topic 
that you specify or publish data to a Kafka topic that you specify.  
To do this, enable {prodname} to discover the Kafka brokers in the cluster. 
Then create a connection to Kafka and add that connection to an 
integration flow. Details are in the following topics:

* xref:enabling-auto-discovery-of-kafka-brokers_{context}[]
* xref:creating-kafka-connections_{context}[]
* xref:adding-kafka-connection-start_{context}[]
* xref:adding-kafka-connection-finish-middle_{context}[]
