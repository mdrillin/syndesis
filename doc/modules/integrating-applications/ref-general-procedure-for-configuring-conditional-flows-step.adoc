After you add a *Conditional Flows* step to a flow, the workflow
for configuring the step is as shown in the following image:

.More about the workflow

* The basic expression builder prompts you for the property that contains the 
content that you want to evaluate, and the condition and value that you want 
to test for. The basic expression builder is suitable for most *Conditional Flows* steps. 

* The advanced expression builder lets you specify a conditional 
expression in Camel Simple Language. 

* You must use the same expression builder for all conditions. 
In other words, to configure a *Conditional Flows* step, you must use the 
basic expression builder or the advanced expression builder. You cannot use both.

* In a conditional flow, you cannot add a *Conditional Flows* step.
