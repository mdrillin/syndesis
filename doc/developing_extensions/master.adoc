= Developing {prodname} extensions

If {prodname} does not provide a feature that is needed to create an
integration, then an expert developer 
can code an extension that provides the needed behavior. The Syndesis 
extension repository, 
link:https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis-extensions[], 
contains examples of extensions. 

A business integrator shares requirements with a developer who codes the 
extension. The developer provides a `.jar` file that contains the extension. 
The business integrator uploads the `.jar` file in {prodname} to make the 
custom connector, custom step(s), or library resource available for use 
in {prodname}. 

The Fuse Tooling plugin to Red Hat Developer Studio provides a wizard
that helps you develop a step extension or a connector extension. It is 
a matter of personal preference whether you choose to develop a step
extension or a connector extension in Developer Studio or in some other
IDE. For information about using the Developer Studio plugin, see 
link:{LinkToolingUserGuide}#igniteextension[Developing extensions for {prodname} integrations].

In this document, the following topics outline the 
procedure, describe the requirements, and provide additional examples for
developing extensions in an IDE that you choose.
